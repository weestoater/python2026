# Python Tutorial for 2026

Welcome to your first Python programming tutorial! This guide will take you from complete beginner to understanding the fundamentals of Python programming.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's one of the most popular programming languages in 2026, used for:
- Web development
- Data science and machine learning
- Automation and scripting
- Software development
- And much more!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your computer
- A text editor or IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad)
- Basic computer skills

## Getting Started

### Installing Python

If you haven't installed Python yet:
1. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or later (Python 3.10+ recommended)
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
4. Verify installation by running: `python --version` or `python3 --version`

### Running Python Programs

There are several ways to run Python code:

1. **Interactive Mode**: Type `python` or `python3` in your terminal
2. **Script Mode**: Run a Python file with `python filename.py`
3. **IDE**: Use an integrated development environment like VS Code or PyCharm

## Tutorial Lessons

### Lesson 1: Hello World

The traditional first program! Learn the basics of:
- Print statements
- Variables
- String formatting
- Loops

**File**: `hello_world.py`

**Run it**:
```bash
python hello_world.py
```

**What you'll learn**:
- How to use the `print()` function
- Working with variables
- F-strings for string formatting
- Basic for loops

### Lesson 2: Data Structures

Understanding Python's built-in data structures is crucial. This lesson covers:
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements

**File**: `data_structures.py`

**Run it**:
```bash
python data_structures.py
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Creating and manipulating lists
- When to use tuples vs lists
- Working with dictionaries for structured data
- Set operations (union, intersection)

### Lesson 3: Functions and Classes

Level up your Python skills with functions and object-oriented programming:
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects
- **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class
- **Object-oriented programming**: A programming paradigm

**File**: `functions_and_classes.py`

**Run it**:
```bash
python functions_and_classes.py
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Defining and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Creating classes and objects
- Working with methods and attributes
- Basic OOP concepts

## Key Python Concepts

### 1. Indentation Matters
Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks. This is different from many other languages that use curly braces.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("This is part of the same block")
print("This is not indented")
```

### 2. Dynamic Typing
You don't need to declare variable types in Python:

```python
x = 5        # x is an integer
x = "hello"  # now x is a string
```

### 3. Zero-Based Indexing
Lists, tuples, and strings use zero-based indexing:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # "apple"
print(fruits[1])  # "banana"
```

### 4. Everything is an Object
In Python, everything is an object with properties and methods:

```python
message = "hello"
print(message.upper())  # "HELLO"
```

## Practice Exercises

After completing the tutorials, try these exercises:

1. **Exercise 1**: Modify `hello_world.py` to greet you by your own name
2. **Exercise 2**: Add a new data structure example to `data_structures.py`
3. **Exercise 3**: Create a new class in `functions_and_classes.py` (e.g., a `Student` class)
4. **Exercise 4**: Write a program that asks for user input using `input()` function
5. **Exercise 5**: Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this tutorial, consider:

1. **Learn more about**:
   - File I/O (reading and writing files)
   - Error handling with try/except
   - Working with modules and packages
   - List comprehensions
   - Generators and iterators

2. **Explore Python libraries**:
   - `requests` - for HTTP requests
   - `pandas` - for data analysis
   - `numpy` - for numerical computing
   - `flask` or `django` - for web development

3. **Build projects**:
   - A to-do list application
   - A simple web scraper
   - A data visualization project
   - A command-line tool
